legislative counsel’s digest
SB 451, Atkins. Personal income and corporation taxes: credits:
rehabilitation of certified historic structures.
The Personal Income Tax Law and the Corporation Tax Law allow various
credits against the taxes imposed by those laws.
This bill would allow to a taxpayer that receives a tax credit allocation a
credit against those taxes for each taxable year beginning on or after January
1, 2021, and before January 1, 2026, in an amount, determined in modified
conformity with a specified section of the Internal Revenue Code, for
rehabilitation of certified historic structures and, under the Personal Income
Tax Law, for a qualified residence. The bill would provide for a 20% credit,
or 25% credit, of qualified rehabilitation expenditures if the structure meets
specified criteria, for rehabilitation of a certified historic structure or a
qualified residence, as provided, within the state to be allocated on a
first-come-first-served basis by the California Tax Credit Allocation
Committee, in conjunction with the Office of Historic Preservation, as
provided. The bill would authorize both of these agencies to charge a
reasonable fee not to exceed a specified amount for costs incurred in carrying
out certain responsibilities related to the tax credit. The aggregate amount
of credit would be $50,000,000 per calendar year, plus unused allocation
tax credit for the preceding year, $10,000,000 of which would be set aside
for rehabilitation projects for qualified residences and for rehabilitation
projects with qualified rehabilitation expenditures of less than $1,000,000,
as specified. The bill would require the Legislative Analyst to, on an annual
basis, collaborate with the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee and
the Office of Historic Preservation to review the effectiveness of the tax
credit, as provided. The bill would also provide that the credit amount is $0
for each taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2021, and before
January 1, 2026, unless otherwise specified in a bill providing for
appropriations related to the Budget Act.
This bill would make specified findings detailing the goals, purposes,
and objectives of the above-described tax credits, performance indicators
for determining whether the credits meet those goals, purposes, and
objectives, and data collection requirements.
93
This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy.
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:
SECTION 1. (a) The Legislature finds and declares that California’s
historic buildings are an important asset to communities throughout the
state, and that the preservation and restoration of these buildings is vital to
economic development, to enhancing civic pride, increasing tourism, and
maintaining vibrant and inclusive neighborhoods.
(b) The Legislature further finds and declares all of the following:
(1) The federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentives program, enacted
by Congress in 1986, established a 20-percent tax credit for the rehabilitation
of historic structures, which remains in effect today. Program activity in the
amount of investment dollars reached record highs in the 1990s, before
declining during the recent recession. With the economy in general, and the
real estate market in particular, rebounding over the last several years, the
amount of rehabilitation investment in proposed projects exceeded $6.5
billion for the second time in the program’s history. The average investment
in completed projects in the 2018 fiscal year was $6.8 million, the highest
amount in the program’s history. The program is currently available to
California’s income producing historic properties, and has generated nearly
$1.6 billion in investment during the last 10 years.
(2) While 35 states have similar state tax credits or incentives for historic
preservation, no such incentive exists in California.
(3) When used with federal historic preservation tax credits, state historic
rehabilitation tax credits provide an important financial incentive for
reinvestment in the historic cores of communities in the post-redevelopment
economy. Historic preservation tax incentives generate jobs, enhance
property values, create affordable housing, and augment revenues for federal,
state, and local governments. Through the federal program, vacant or
underutilized schools, warehouses, factories, apartments, churches, retail
stores, hotels, houses, farms, and offices throughout the country have been
restored to life in a manner that maintains their historic character.
(4) States that have partnered a state incentive with the federal Historic
Preservation Tax Incentives program have reaped significant economic
development benefits, including construction and building industry job
creation, increased state tax revenues through increased employment and
wages, increased local property tax revenues through increased property
values, and increased local tax revenues through sales taxes and heritage
tourism.
(5) The federal rehabilitation tax credit applies specifically to
income-producing historic properties, and throughout its history has
leveraged many times its cost in private expenditures on historic preservation.
This program is the largest federal program specifically supporting historic
preservation, generating over $144.6 billion in historic preservation activity
since 1976. During the 2018 fiscal year, the National Park Service approved
93
— 2 —
Ch. 703
1,013 proposed projects, representing an estimated $6.89 billion of
investment to restore and rehabilitate historic buildings.
(6) The federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentives program remains
an outstanding means of leveraging private investment in the adaptive reuse
and preservation of historic buildings. The program continues to help
stimulate economic recovery in older communities, both large and small,
throughout the nation, and created an estimated 108,861 jobs in 2017.
(7) Over the last 10 years, California has had 127 projects qualify for the
federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentives program. These projects have
been located in 20 different counties.
(8) As California communities continue to adjust and adapt to the
dissolution of redevelopment agencies, proven tools are still needed to
incentivize economic development and revitalize economically distressed
areas.
SEC. 2. Section 38.10 is added to the Revenue and Taxation Code, to
read:
38.10. (a) The Legislative Analyst shall, on an annual basis beginning
January 1, 2021, collaborate with the California Tax Credit Allocation
Committee and the Office of Historic Preservation to review the effectiveness
of the tax credits allowed by Sections 17053.91 and 23691. The review shall
include, but is not limited to, an analysis of the demand for the tax credit,
the types and uses of projects receiving the tax credit, the jobs created by
the use of the tax credits, and the economic impact of the tax credits.
(b) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2026, and as
of that date is repealed.
SEC. 3. Section 17053.91 is added to the Revenue and Taxation Code,

Revenue Code, except as provided in paragraph (2), the applicable
percentage shall be 20 percent of the qualified rehabilitation expenditures
with respect to a certified historic structure.
(2) The applicable percentage shall be 25 percent of the qualified
rehabilitation expenditures with respect to a certified historic structure if
that certified historic structure meets one of the following criteria:

limited to, rehabilitation of the electrical, plumbing, or foundation of the
